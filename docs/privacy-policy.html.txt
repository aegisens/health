        <li><strong>Voice & Biometric Data (Future Service, with explicit consent):</strong> If you choose to use features like voice analysis, we may process voice snippets and related biometric markers (e.g., vocal stress patterns) solely to provide personalized health insights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use your data solely to build and provide Aegisens:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To communicate with you (waitlist updates, service invitations).</li>
        <li>To personalize and improve our future AI-driven health insights.</li>
        <li>To analyze trends and ensure the security of our service.</li>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>We do not sell your personal data. We do not use it for third-party advertising.</strong></p>

    <h2>3. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)</h2>
    <p>For users in the European Union, our processing is based on:
